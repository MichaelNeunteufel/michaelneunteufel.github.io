  abstract = {We propose two parameter-robust mixed finite element methods for linear Cosserat elasticity. The Cosserat coupling constant \${\textbackslash}mu\_c\$, connecting the displacement \$u\$ and rotation vector \${\textbackslash}omega\$, leads to possible locking phenomena in finite element methods. The formal limit of \${\textbackslash}mu\_c{\textbackslash}to{\textbackslash}infty\$ enforces the constraint \${\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{2\}{\textbackslash}operatorname\{curl\}u = {\textbackslash}omega\$ and leads to the fourth order couple stress problem. Viewing the linear Cosserat model as the Hodge-Laplacian problem of a twisted de Rham complex, we derive structure-preserving distributional finite element spaces, where the limit constraint is fulfilled in the discrete setting. Applying the mass conserving mixed stress (MCS) method for the rotations, the resulting scheme is robust in \${\textbackslash}mu\_c\$. Combining it with the tangential-displacement normal-normal-stress (TDNNS) method for the displacement part we obtain additional robustness in the nearly incompressible regime and for anisotropic structures. Using a post-processing scheme for the rotations, we prove optimal convergence rates independent of the Cosserat coupling constant \${\textbackslash}mu\_c\$. Further, we propose a mixed method for the couple stress problem based on the MCS scheme. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods in several numerical benchmark examples.},

We study the convergence of the distributional Einstein curvature of \$g\_\{h\}\$ to the Einstein curvature of \$g\$ under refinement of the triangulation. We show that in the \$H{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}({\textbackslash}varOmega )\$-norm this convergence takes place at a rate of \$O(h{\textasciicircum}\{r+1\})\$ when \$g\_\{h\}\$ is an optimal-order interpolant of \$g\$ that is piecewise polynomial of degree \$r {\textbackslash}ge 1\$.

  abstract = {In this paper we propose a generalization of the Riemann curvature tensor on manifolds (of dimension two or higher) endowed with a Regge metric. Specifically, while all components of the metric tensor are assumed to be smooth within elements of a triangulation of the manifold, they need not be smooth across element interfaces, where only continuity of the tangential components are assumed. While linear derivatives of the metric can be generalized as Schwartz distributions, similarly generalizing the classical Riemann curvature tensor, a nonlinear second-order derivative of the metric, requires more care. We propose a generalization combining the classical angle defect and jumps of the second fundamental form across element interfaces, and rigorously prove correctness of this generalization. Specifically, if a piecewise smooth metric approximates a globally smooth metric, our generalized Riemann curvature tensor approximates the classical Riemann curvature tensor arising from a globally smooth metric. Moreover, we show that if the metric approximation converges at some rate in a piecewise norm that scales like the \$L{\textasciicircum}2\$-norm, then the curvature approximation converges in the \$H{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$-norm at the same rate, under additional assumptions. By appropriate contractions of the generalized Riemann curvature tensor, this work also provides generalizations of scalar curvature, the Ricci curvature tensor, and the Einstein tensor in any dimension.},

Specifically, we investigate the interplay between the polynomial degree of the curvature lifting by Lagrange elements and the degree of the metric tensor in the Regge finite element space. Previously, a superconvergence result, where convergence rate of one order higher than expected, was obtained when the approximate metric is the canonical Regge interpolant of the exact metric. In this work, we show that an even higher order can be obtained if the degree of the curvature lifting is reduced by one polynomial degree and if at least linear Regge elements are used.

  abstract = {In this work mixed formulations for nonlinear problems in continuum mechanics and shells are presented and discussed. While standard methods in continuum mechanics, where the displacement field is used as unknown, often suffer from non-robust formulations, a combination of function spaces with lower regularity assumptions may circumvent so-called ``locking'' phenomena. Mixed two-field methods, where the stress tensor is considered as additional unknown, are already used quite often in linear elasticity. These approaches, however, can mostly not directly be generalized to nonlinear materials, as they are in general not invertable. Additionally, geometric nonlinearities require multiplication of derivatives, which are not well-defined for spaces with low regularities. With this motivation so-called three-field formulations are proposed, where a lifting of distributional derivatives to square-integrable functions is accomplished. This approach is further extended to (nearly) incompressible materials. For (nonlinear) Koiter shells a twice weakly differentiable displacement field is required, as a fourth-order differential operator is involved. The construction of such globally differentiable finite elements has turned out to be extremely challenging. Instead, we introduce an additional stress field to enable displacements to be in a first order Sobolev space and thus more simple finite elements are available. We show that this method simplifies to the Hellan-Herrmann-Johnson method in the small strain regime for plates. Further, extensions to nonlinear Naghdi shells are presented. For thin shell structures so-called membrane locking occurs for curved elements. We present an interpolation procedure based on the less common Regge finite elements to prevent this locking behavior for triangulations. This approach can be accomplished with finite elements for the topological dual space as mixed variational problem. We discuss connections between the presented methods and existing elements.},

Two different discretizations for the Navier-Stokes equations are discussed: the popular Taylor-Hood elements and the H(div)-conforming Hybrid Discontinuous Galerkin method, which ensures exact divergence-freeness. For the elastic wave equation a standard Newmark method is used and a new H(curl)-conforming method is introduced. Therefore, an additional variable is needed: the time derivative of the momentum, which is in the dual space of H(curl). The Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian description is well understood for H1-conforming methods, where the mesh velocity appears in the Navier-Stokes equations. For H(div)-conforming schemes, however, the ALE method is more involved and an additional term appears, which plays a crucial role. The methods are implemented in NGS-Py, which is based on the finite element library Netgen/NGSolve and tested with proper examples.},

This includes reinforcements placed in soft matrix material in lightweight structure design, or hollow structures that are partially or completely filled. Finite element simulations of such setups are highly challenging. A brute force discretization of structural as well as volumetric parts using well-shaped three-dimensional elements may be accurate, but leads to problems of enormous computational complexity even for simple models. One desired alternative is the use of shell elements for thin-walled parts, as such a discretization greatly alleviates size restrictions on the underlying finite element mesh. However, the coupling of different formulations within a single framework is often not straightforward and may lead to locking if not done carefully. Neunteufel and Sch{\"o}berl proposed a mixed shell element where, apart from displacements of the center surface, bending moments are used as independent unknowns. These elements were not only shown to be locking free and highly accurate in large-deformation regime, but also do not require differentiability of the shell surface and can handle kinked and branched shell structures. They can directly be coupled to classical volume elements of arbitrary order by sharing displacement degrees of freedom at the center surface, thus achieving the desired coupled discretization. As the elements can be used on unstructured meshes, adaptive mesh refinement based on local stress and bending moments can be used. We present computational results that confirm exceptional accuracy for problems where thin-walled structures are embedded as reinforcements within soft matrix material.},

Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with two numerical examples.},

  abstract = {In this work we develop new finite element discretisations of the shear-deformable Reissner--Mindlin plate problem based on the Hellinger--Reissner principle of symmetric stresses. Specifically, we use conforming Hu-Zhang elements to discretise the bending moments in the space of symmetric square integrable fields with a square integrable divergence \$M \in \mathrm{HZ} \subset H\_{\mathrm{sym}}(\mathrm{Div})\$. The latter results in highly accurate approximations of the bending moments M and in the rotation field being in the Lebesgue space \$\phi\in [L{\textasciicircum}2]{\textasciicircum}2\$, such that the Kirchhoff--Love constraint can be satisfied for \$t\rightarrow0\$. In order to preserve optimal convergence rates across all variables for the case \$t\rightarrow0\$, we present an extension of the formulation using Raviart--Thomas elements for the shear stress \$q\in \mathrm{RT} \subset H(\mathrm{div})\$. We prove existence and uniqueness in the continuous setting and rely on exact complexes for inheritance of well-posedness in the discrete setting. This work introduces an efficient construction of the Hu-Zhang base functions on the reference element via the polytopal template methodology and Legendre polynomials, making it applicable to hp-FEM. The base functions on the reference element are then mapped to the physical element using novel polytopal transformations, which are suitable also for curved geometries. The robustness of the formulations and the construction of the Hu-Zhang element are tested for shear-locking, curved geometries and an L-shaped domain with a singularity in the bending moments M. Further, we compare the performance of the novel formulations with the primal-, MITC- and recently introduced TDNNS methods.},

These finite element spaces are essential for achieving well-posed discretisations of mixed formulations of partial differential equations that involve tensor-valued functions, such as the Hellinger-Reissner formulation of linear elasticity. In our proposed polytopal template method, the basis functions are constructed from template tensors associated with the geometric polytopes (vertices, edges, faces etc.) of the reference simplex and any scalar-valued \$H{\textasciicircum}1\$-conforming finite element space. From this starting point we can construct the Regge, Hellan-Herrmann-Johnson, Pechstein-Sch{\textbackslash}"oberl, Hu-Zhang, Hu-Ma-Sun and Gopalakrishnan-Lederer-Sch{\textbackslash}"oberl elements. Because the Hu-Zhang element and the Hu-Ma-Sun element cannot be mapped from the reference simplex to a physical simplex via standard double Piola mappings, we also demonstrate that the polytopal template tensors can be used to define a consistent mapping from a reference simplex even to a non-affine simplex in the physical mesh. Finally, we discuss the implications of element regularity with two numerical examples for the Reissner-Mindlin plate problem.},

  abstract = {One approach for the simulation of metamaterials is to extend an associated continuum theory concerning its kinematic equations, and the relaxed micromorphic continuum represents such a model. It incorporates the Curl of the nonsymmetric microdistortion in the free energy function. This suggests the existence of solutions not belonging to \$H{\textasciicircum}1\$, such that standard nodal \$H{\textasciicircum}1\$-finite elements yield unsatisfactory convergence rates and might be incapable of finding the exact solution. Our approach is to use base functions stemming from both Hilbert spaces \$H{\textasciicircum}1\$ and \$H ({\textbackslash}mathrm\{curl\})\$, demonstrating the central role of such combinations for this class of problems. For simplicity, a reduced two-dimensional relaxed micromorphic continuum describing antiplane shear is introduced, preserving the main computational traits of the three-dimensional version. This model is then used for the formulation and a multi step investigation of a viable finite element solution, encompassing examinations of existence and uniqueness of both standard and mixed formulations and their respective convergence rates.},

  abstract = {The classical Cauchy continuum theory is suitable to model highly homogeneous materials. However, many materials, such as porous media or metamaterials, exhibit a pronounced microstructure. As a result, the classical continuum theory cannot capture their mechanical behaviour without fully resolving the underlying microstructure. In terms of finite element computations, this can be done by modelling the entire body, including every interior cell. The relaxed micromorphic continuum offers an alternative method by instead enriching the kinematics of the mathematical model. The theory introduces a microdistortion field, encompassing nine extra degrees of freedom for each material point. The corresponding elastic energy functional contains the gradient of the displacement field, the microdistortion field and its Curl (the micro-dislocation). Therefore, the natural spaces of the fields are \$[H{\textasciicircum}1]{\textasciicircum}3\$ for the displacement and \$[H({\textbackslash}mathrm\{curl\})]{\textasciicircum}3\$ for the microdistortion, leading to unusual finite element formulations. In this work we describe the construction of appropriate finite elements using N{\'e}d{\'e}lec and Raviart--Thomas subspaces, encompassing solutions to the orientation problem and the discrete consistent coupling condition. Further, we explore the numerical behaviour of the relaxed micromorphic model for both a primal and a mixed formulation. The focus of our benchmarks lies in the influence of the characteristic length \$L\_c\$ and the correlation to the classical Cauchy continuum theory.},

If not possible, we investigate if it is possible to determine it pressure robustly, i.e. pollution free from the pressure reaction. For convex domains there is but one variational boundary value problem among the investigated that allows the independent determination. It is the one with essential no-penetration conditions combined with homogeneous tangential traction conditions. Further, for the investigated cases, the weakly divergence-free displacement can be computed pressure robustly provided the total body force is decomposed into its direct sum of divergence- and rotation-free components using the Helmholtz decomposition. The elasticity problem is solved using these components as separate right-hand sides. The total solution is obtained using the superposition principle. We employ a (u,p) higher-order finite element formulation with discontinuous pressure elements. It is inf--sup stable for polynomial degree \$p\geq2\$ but not pressure robust by itself. We propose a three step procedure to solve the elasticity problem which includes by the Helmholtz decomposition of the total body force. The extra cost for the three-step procedure is essentially the cost for the Helmholtz decomposition of the assembled total body force, and the small cost of solving the elasticity problem with one extra right-hand side. The results are corroborated by theoretical derivations as well as numerical results.},

Static condensation can be applied at the element level, providing a global pure displacement problem to be solved. We present a stabilization motivated by Hybrid Discontinuous Galerkin methods.

  abstract = {This paper studies guided transverse scalar modes propagating through helically coiled waveguides. Modeling the modes as solutions of the Helmholtz equation within the three-dimensional (3D) waveguide geometry, a propagation ansatz transforms the mode-finding problem into a 3D quadratic eigenproblem. Through an untwisting map, the problem is shown to be equivalent to a 3D quadratic eigenproblem on a straightened configuration. Next, exploiting the constant torsion and curvature of the Frenet frame of a circular helix, the 3D eigenproblem is further reduced to a two-dimensional (2D) eigenproblem on the waveguide cross section. All three eigenproblems are numerically treated. As expected, significant computational savings are realized in the 2D model. A few nontrivial numerical techniques are needed to make the computation of modes within the 3D geometry feasible. They are presented along with a procedure to effectively filter out unwanted non-propagating eigenfunctions. Computational results show that the geometric effect of coiling is to shift the localization of guided modes away from the coiling center. The variations in modes as coiling pitch is changed are reported considering the example of a coiled optical fiber.},
