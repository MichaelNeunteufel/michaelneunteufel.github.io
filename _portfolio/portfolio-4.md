title: "Shape optimization"

In several problems in industry and medicine, including the optimal design of aircraft, electric motors, or electric impedance tomography, an optimal shape with respect to a given objective function under constraints is searched for. Shape optimization problems involve the shape derivative
of possibly lengthy and complicated expressions. We implemented an automated shape differentiation tool in the open-source finite element software [NGSolve](https://www.ngsolve.org), enabling shape gradient and shape Newton methods without the need to compute the shape derivative by hand [[2021](https://michaelneunteufel.github.io/publication/2021-GSNS-Fully-and-)]. In addition, this makes using non-Lagrangian finite elements in shape optimization problems more attractive, where additional space-dependent transformation rules have to be differentiated.

We have successfully applied this framework to minimize the Canham--Helfrich--Evans (CHE) bending energy in the context of cell membranes [[2023](https://michaelneunteufel.github.io/publication/2023-NSS-Numerical-)]. The method used to reduce the fourth-order problem to a mixed second-order problem turned out to be fruitful in combination with the theory of shape optimization.
