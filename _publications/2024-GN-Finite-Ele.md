We analyze finite element discretizations of scalar curvature in $$ N \geq 2 $$ dimension. Our analysis focuses on piecewise polynomial interpolants of a smooth Riemannian metric $$g$$ on a simplicial triangulation of a polyhedral domain $$\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N $$ having maximum element diameter $$h$$. We show that if such an interpolant $$g_h$$ has polynomial degree $$ r\geq 0$$ and possesses single-valued tangential-tangential components on codimension-1 simplices, then it admits a natural notion of (densitized) scalar curvature that converges in the $$H^{-2}(\Omega)$$-norm to the (densitized) scalar curvature of $$g$$ at a rate of $$O(h^{r+1})$$ as $$h\to 0$$, provided that either $$N=2$$ or $$r\geq 1$$. As a special case, our result implies the convergence in $$H^{-2}(\Omega)$$ of the widely used &apos;&apos;angle defect&apos;&apos; approximation of Gaussian curvature on two-dimensional triangulations, without stringent assumptions on the interpolated metric $$g_h$$. We present numerical experiments that indicate that our analytical estimates are sharp.
