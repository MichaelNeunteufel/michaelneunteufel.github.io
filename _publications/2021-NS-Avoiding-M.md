In this paper we present a method to overcome membrane locking of thin shells. An interpolation operator into the so-called Regge finite element space is inserted in the membrane energy term to weaken the implicitly given kernel constraints. The number of constraints is decreased on triangular meshes compared to reduced integration techniques, in the lowest order case asymptotically by a factor two. A tying point procedure to accomplish the interpolation is presented revealing a strong connection to MITC shell elements. Provided the interpolant, this approach can be incorporated easily into existing shell elements. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by means of several benchmark examples.
