One approach for the simulation of metamaterials is to extend an associated continuum theory concerning its kinematic equations, and the relaxed micromorphic continuum represents such a model. It incorporates the Curl of the nonsymmetric microdistortion in the free energy function. This suggests the existence of solutions not belonging to $$H^1$$, such that standard nodal $$H^1$$-finite elements yield unsatisfactory convergence rates and might be incapable of finding the exact solution. Our approach is to use base functions stemming from both Hilbert spaces $$H^1$$ and $$H (\mathrm{curl})$$, demonstrating the central role of such combinations for this class of problems. For simplicity, a reduced two-dimensional relaxed micromorphic continuum describing antiplane shear is introduced, preserving the main computational traits of the three-dimensional version. This model is then used for the formulation and a multi step investigation of a viable finite element solution, encompassing examinations of existence and uniqueness of both standard and mixed formulations and their respective convergence rates.
