We address a three-dimensional model capable of describing coupled damage and plastic effects in solids at finite strains. Formulated within the variational setting of generalized standard materials, the constitutive model results from the balance of conservative and dissipative forces. Material response is rate-independent and associative and damage evolution is unidirectional. We assess the model features and performance on both uniaxial and non-proportional biaxial tests. The constitutive model is then complemented with the quasistatic equilibrium system and initial and boundary conditions. We produce numerical simulations with the help of the multiphysics finite element software NETGEN/NGSolve. We show the flexibility of the implementation and run simulations for various 2D and 3D settings under different choices of boundary conditions and possibly in presence of pre-damaged regions.
