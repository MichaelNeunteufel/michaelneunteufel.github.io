The Babu&scaron;ka or plate paradox concerns the failure of convergence when a domain with curved boundary is approximated by polygonal domains in linear bending problems with simple support boundary conditions. It can be explained via a boundary integral representation of the total Gaussian curvature that is part of the Kirchhoff--Love bending energy. It is shown that the paradox also occurs for a nonlinear bending-folding model which enforces vanishing Gaussian curvature. A simple remedy that is compatible with simplicial finite element methods to avoid wrong convergence is devised.
