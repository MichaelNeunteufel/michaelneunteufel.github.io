In this paper a novel application of the (high-order) H(div)-conforming Hybrid Discontinuous Galerkin finite element method for monolithic fluid-structure interaction (FSI) is presented. The Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) description is derived for H(div)-conforming finite elements including the Piola transformation, yielding exact divergence free fluid velocity solutions. The arising method is demonstrated by means of the benchmark problems proposed by Turek and Hron (2006). With hp-refinement strategies singularities and boundary layers are overcome leading to optimal spatial convergence rates.
