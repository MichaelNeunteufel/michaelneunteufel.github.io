In this work we construct novel $$H(\mathrm{sym} \mathrm{Curl})$$-conforming finite elements for the recently introduced relaxed micromorphic sequence, which can be considered as the completion of the $$\mathrm{div} \mathrm{Div}$$-sequence with respect to the $$H(\mathrm{sym} \mathrm{Curl})$$-space. The elements respect $$H(\mathrm{Curl})$$-regularity and their lowest order versions converge optimally for $$[H(\mathrm{sym} \mathrm{Curl}) \setminus H(\mathrm{Curl})]$$-fields. This work introduces a detailed construction, proofs of linear independence and conformity of the basis, and numerical examples. Further, we demonstrate an application to the computation of metamaterials with the relaxed micromorphic model.
