<h2>Abstract:</h2>
Fluid-structure-interaction  problems  arise  in  a  variety  of  engineering  applications
and finding appropriate discretization is still challenging.  Often Taylor-Hood elements
for the fluid and H1-conforming elements for the solid are used,  as they are easy to
implement, however they entail some disadvantages.\\
In this talk we present a new kind of coupling of the Navier-Stokes equations with
the elastic wave equation using mixed methods.\\
The H(div)-conforming Hybrid Discontinuous Galerkin method is used for the dis-
cretization  of  the  Navier-Stokes  equations,  which  brings  a  new  term  in  the  Arbitrary
Lagrangian Eulerian description besides the appearing mesh velocity.
For the elasticity part we introduce a new method, which is based on the idea to use
H(curl)-conforming elements for the velocity instead of standard H1-elements.  There-
fore an additional variable is needed:  the momentum, for which we use the dual space of
H(curl).\\
The method is implemented in NGS-Py, which is based on the finite element library
Netgen/NGSolve (www.ngsolve.org). Finally, we present first numerical results.
