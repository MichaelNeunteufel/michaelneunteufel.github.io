<h2>Abstract:</h2>
For solving Kirchhoff plates the HHJ method introduces a moment tensor for computing the fourth order equation as a mixed method. We present a generalization of these method to nonlinear shells, where we allow large strains and rotations. Focusing on the bending energy, we will use the finite element space H(divdiv) for the moments. Non-smooth surfaces and branching shells with kinks can be handled without rewriting terms. Numerical examples are presented using Netgen/NGSolve.
