<h2>Abstract:</h2>
Many engineering applications involve thin elastic structures, which are typically treated by models of reduced dimensions, so called shell models.\\
We sketch the derivation of a 5-parameter shell model from geometric nonlinear 3D elasticity, and discuss proper continuity conditions of the involved fields: displacements shall be continuous, rotations tangential continuous, and bending moments normal-normal continuous.\\
We present a new finite element method, which is based on two existing formulations: The Hellan-Herrmann-Johnson method for Kirchhoff plates, and the tangential-displacement normal-normal-stress method for solid mechanics. Both are mixed methods using normal-normal continuous tensor-valued elements, and standard H1-elements or Nedelec elements, respectively.\\
We obtain a discrete constrained energy minimization problem, which is solved by Newton's method with line-search.
We discuss the implementation in ngs-py, and present several numerical examples including piecewise smooth structures with junctions.
